# UA571C
A recreation of the UA 571-C Remote Sentry Weapon System display from Aliens - Written in GRiD OS.

Well, I had to test the development environment, somehow!

(apologies for the audio, new filter chain, and I only had time to record this ONCE)

As part of @tr1nitr0n and myself rebuilding the GRiD Development Environment from batches of GRiD server hard drives, I needed something to test that the development environment that could compile Pascal, PL/M, Fortran, C and Assembler was working as expected. Then I thought about the sentry remote weapon system scenes that were cut from the theatrical release of James Cameron's Aliens (1986) film, which used GRiD Compass II 1129 laptops. GRiD had developed a set of working displays in GRiDBASIC for the film. These were never released, but now that the same tools are working again, I recreated them.
