GRiDTask is a programming language that can allow for the creation of simple programs, forms, and scripting for other GRiD programs. Created by Jeff Hawkins for demos and automating functions for other GRiD software, it was initially just used internally at GRiD. Eventually, they realized it had potential as a standalone product and it was released to some success.

The disks here are for GRiD-OS. As such, you will need to format the floppy disks you want to use with the GRiD-OS disk formatting utility (Initialize Media) before writing to them in ImageDisk. In order to format a 720kB disk for GRiD-OS, you'll also need to use a newer version of Initialize Media.


Disk Type: 720kB, 3.5" (GTASKII3.IMD); 360kB, 5.25" (GTASKII5.IMD)
OS/File Format: GRiD-OS
Disk Image Type: ImageDisk (.imd)
